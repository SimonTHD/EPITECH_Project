## AnonymousGoose

### Overview
**AnonymousGoose** is a Linux version of the Desktop Goose. You have been hacked by an evil goose and you must escape. Be warned, as the goose won't let you use typical actions to stop the virus. Don't even try to run `htop` or `top`.

Once downloaded, you can simply use the `./run.sh` script to start it again.
