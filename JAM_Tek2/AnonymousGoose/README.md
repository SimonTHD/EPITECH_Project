# AnonymousGoose

A linux version of the Desktop Goose.

You have been hacked by an evil goose and you must escape. But be warned that the goose won't let you use usual actions to stop the virus. Don't even try to run htop or top.

Once downloaded, you can simply use the ``./run.sh`` to start it again.
